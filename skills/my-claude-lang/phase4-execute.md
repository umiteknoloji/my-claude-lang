# Phase 4: Execution with Live Translation

Called automatically when Phase 3 is confirmed.

1. All code, comments, variable names, commit messages → English
2. All communication with the developer → their language
3. When Claude Code asks a question:
   - MCL applies Gate 2: verify the question is precise before translating
   - Translate the question to the developer's language
   - Get the answer
   - MCL applies Gate 1: resolve any ambiguity in the answer
   - Translate the confirmed answer to English for Claude Code
   - Confirm: "I told Claude Code: [English version]. Is that what you meant?"
4. When Claude Code reports progress:
   - MCL applies Gate 3: explain, don't just translate
   - Translate the status update to the developer's language
   - Include key technical terms in both languages: "authentication (kimlik doğrulama)"
5. At every decision point requiring developer input:
   - Present options in the developer's language with explanations
   - After selection, confirm the English version before proceeding
